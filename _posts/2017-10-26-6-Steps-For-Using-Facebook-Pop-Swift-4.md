title: How to Use Facebook Pop Swift 4
---

I've always used maxmyers' [5 step guide](https://github.com/maxmyers/FacebookPop) when I needed a quick refresher on [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop) but now that I'm starting to integrate it in more Swift projects I decided to write a Swift 4 version.

Check out "6 Steps for Using Facebook Pop in Swift 4" on [Github](https://github.com/psobko/FacebookPopSwift).
